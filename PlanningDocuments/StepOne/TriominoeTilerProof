Goal: Given a 2^n x 2^n board with one piece removed, tile the rest using triominoes.

Proof of Concept:

    Can you tile a 2^n x 2^n board with one square/piece removed with triominoes?

    Proof by Induction on n

    Inductive Hypothesis:
        Let F(n) be the statement that a 2^n x 2^n board with one square removed can be tiled with triominoes.
        Assume F(n) is true.

    Inductive Step:
        Assuming F(n) is true, prove that F(n) -> F(n+1).

        Given F(n), that a 2^n x 2^n board with one square removed can be tiled with triominoes,
        Want to Prove F(n+1) must be true, or that F(n) -> F(n+1)

        Thus, given an algorithm that will tile a 2^n x 2^n board with one square removed using triominoes,
        Give an algorithm that will tile a 2^(n+1) x 2^(n+1) board with one square removed.

        The 2^(n+1) x 2^(n+1) board is quadruple the size of the 2^n x 2^n board.
        Divide this 2^(n+1) x 2^(n+1) board into four quadrants.
        Each quadrant will have size 2^n x 2^n.

        The square removed from the board has to be in one of these four quadrants since the quadrants
        form the original 2^(n+1) x 2^(n+1) board which contained the square before it was removed.

        Say the square removed was taken from the upper left quadrant.
        This quadrant is a 2^n x 2^n board and by F(n) can therefore be tiled.
        
        Next, add a triominoe piece such that it's center is the center of the board, and it's three
        corners are in the upper right, bottom right, and bottom left quardants.

        Each remaining quadrant is also a 2^n x 2^n board.
        The remaining quadrants now have exactly one square/piece occupied by the newly added triominoe piece.
        
        Therefore, tiling each of the remaining quadrants becomes the problem of tiling a 2^n x 2^n board
        with one piece removed using only triominoes. Which is exactly the problem that F(n) asserts is solveable.
        Therefore, each of these remaining quadrants can also be tiled.
        Thus, the rest of the board can be tiled.

        The proof that the board can be tiled given that the square removed came from any of the other three
        quadrants is similar to the aforementioned proof, and has been omitted for brevity.

        Therefore, given that a 2^n x 2^n board with one square removed can be tiled with triominoes,
        a 2^(n+1) x 2^(n+1) board with one square removed can be tiled with triominoes.

        Q.E.D. F(n) -> F(n+1)

    Base Case:
        Prove F(1) is true.
        Given a 2^(1) x 2^(1) board with a square removed, proof that it can be tiled using only triominoes.

        There are four cases, each a rotation of the other.
        Given a 2^(1) x 2^(1) board with the (0,0) square removed, tile it thusly:

        0 A
        A A

        Where 0 represents the removed square, and A represents a space taken up by a triominoe with colour A.
